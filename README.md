# BundelB - a file bundler and browser #

The projects goal is to create a program that will enable users to bundle different documents with different filetypes together into one 'Bundle'.
A bundle will then become its own document in which documents can be imported and categorized. An 'Export to pdf' function is high on the wishlist. Which will allow a user to export the entire bundle as a pdf ebook, where catories will turn into chapters.

Currently, support for HTML and Markdown is being worked on. Futere file types included could be .pdf and office document filetypes. 
Other future addition might include a build-in python scrapy implementation which will allow the user to rip relevant information from common web layouts, like wikimedia type webpages or from a website like Stackoverflow.com. 

The current development of this project is in a very early stage. The java code is beeing writen while i'm studying to become a programmer and is therefore subject to a great many changes.
